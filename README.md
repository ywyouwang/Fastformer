# Fastformer

Re-implemented the Fastformer model (a Transformer-based model) following a published study, experimented the influence of pretrained embeddings and parameter sharing.

Performed sentiment analysis on Yelp review dataset and SST-2 dataset, achieved the accuracy of 55.2% and 86.7%, F1-score of 0.544 and 0.863, outperformed the Transformer with the same set of parameters.

Examined the misclassified cased and class-wise accuracies for both Fastformer and Transformer, analyzed the different predicting pattern.
